SPEECHES
Bernard Collaery, ‘The challenges of representing the interests of members of the intelligence
community’, Derek Fielding Memorial Lecture, 5 October 2022
Bernard Collaery gave the annual Derek Fielding Memorial Lecture, hosted by the Queensland Council
Civil Liberties, on 5 October 2022. Mr Collaery, a lawyer and former ACT Attorney-General, was a lawyer
to former intelligence officer and whistle-blower Witness K. Witness K exposed a secret Australian
mission to bug Timor-Leste’s government offices during treaty negotiations regarding the oil and gas
reserves in the Timor Sea. Mr Collaery was prosecuted over allegations that he conspired with Witness
K to breach s 39 Intelligence Services Act 2001 (Cth) or had otherwise improperly disclosed information
affecting ASIS activity. His prosecution was a concern to lawyers across Australia and the globe and
attracted national and international outcry. In July this year – after four years of proceedings – Attorney-
General Mark Dreyfus KC used his power under s 71 Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) to not proceed with the
indictments against Mr Collaery. This was his first public statement since his prosecution was dropped.
Mr Collaery explained his experience of being prosecuted under the National Security Information
(Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 (Cth) (“NIS Act”). His prosecution involved “judge-only”
evidence, tendered by the Commonwealth, which, due to national security concerns, Mr Collaery, as
the defendant, could not see. At least 55 warrants were issued to authorise intrusive searches and
interception activity of Witness K and Mr Collaery. At each of his 60 court appearances the court’s
security cameras were duct taped over and the transcription recording device physically removed from
the court room and replaced with an ASIS transcriber. He also spoke of his work prior to his prosecution
when he assisted the Timorese government at the International Court of Arbitration, and how Australia
breached orders made by the International Court of Justice in having the AFP raid his offices and harass
his employees.
Mr Collaery was critical of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign
Interference) Act 2018 (Cth) and the Foreign Influence and Transparency Scheme Act 2018 (Cth) which
expand the offences relating to espionage to include the mere possession of classified information.
These laws were used in raids on journalist Annika Smethurst and the ABC. While there is a public
interest defence, Mr Collaery noted that, in the absence of a statutory definition, a journalist has to
“weigh up the onus of having to prove that the disclosure was in the public interest against the prospect
Queensland Law Reporter – 4 November 2022 – [2022] 43 QLR
2

;of being sentenced to five years in jail”. This defence, opined Mr Collaery, is potentially not available if
the person is not a journalist but a blogger.
Mr Collaery noted that while his prosecution was halted, there is a risk that it will happen again to other
lawyers, whistle-blowers or journalists. He was concerned that, “while the coalition government has
been defeated at the polls” the staff and culture which “supported poor policy decision-making remain
within the bureaucracy”. He stated that the NIS Act “should either be removed from the statute book or
made unusable by corrupt political actors”. Mr Collaery further called for a Royal Commission into our
intelligence services.

The Hon Justice Stephen Gageler AC, High Court of Australia, “Judicial Legitimacy”, Keynote
Address at the 2022 Australian Judicial Officers Association Colloquium in Hobart, Tasmania on
Friday 7 October 2022.
Justice Gageler delivered the keynote address at the Australian Judicial Officers Association Colloquium
held in Hobart this year after a 2-year Covid-19 Hiatus.
In this speech, his Honour tackles the topic of Judicial Legitimacy. His Honour’s theme is “that before
getting judicial independence, what is needed for judicial legitimacy is a judiciary that truly is and is seen
to be competent and impartial.” Justice Gageler turns to the Supreme Court of the United States to
illustrate the link between judicial impartiality and judicial legitimacy and “illustrate the significance to
both of judicial appointment.” It was and is, in his Honour’s view, “an institution undergoing a crisis of
legitimacy.” As an example, His Honour refers to the reactions of various members of the political class
to the decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organisation. His Honour concludes that the
reactions to that decision were “manifestations of an erosion of judicial legitimacy resulting from a
realistic perception that a partisan process of judicial appointment had led to a partisan judiciary”. His
Honour issues a cautionary and frank observation that “we fool ourselves if we think that something of
the kind could not happen here.” To that end his Honour expressly declares his support for the Latimer
House Principle that “judicial appointments should be made on the basis of clearly defined criteria and
by a publicly declared process.”
The full text of his Honour’s speech is available here. A link to the programme which includes references
to some of the other speeches delivered at the Colloquium is here.
FCFCOA EXPANSION OF THE LIGHTHOUSE MODEL – UPDATE TO THE
PROFESSSION
Following Tuesday’s Budget announcement, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division
1 and 2) have been working on the expansion of the Lighthouse model, a world-leading innovation to
the risk screening, triage and assessment of family law matters, to 15 family law registries. The purpose
of the Lighthouse model expansion is to identify risks of family violence at the point of filing. The
introduction of the Lighthouse model and risk screening nationally strengthens and assists the Courts’
ability to identify risks early and respond to those risks.
The expansion of the Lighthouse model will mean that from 28 November 2022 risk screening, triage
and differentiated case management, including the Evatt List will be available in Adelaide, Brisbane,
Cairns, Canberra, Dandenong, Darwin, Hobart, Launceston, Melbourne, Newcastle, Parramatta,
Rockhampton, Sydney, Townsville, and Wollongong in both parenting only and parenting/financial
cases.

WORKERS’ COMPENSATION – WHETHER THE WORKER HAD “TAKEN
PROCEEDINGS TO RECOVER, DAMAGES” FOR THE INJURY – WHETHER THE
INSURER’S RIGHT TO INDEMNITY WAS EXCLUDED IF THE WORKER HAD
“TAKEN PROCEEDINGS” – S 207B(8) WORKERS’ COMPENSATION AND
REHABILITATION ACT 2003
Wallaby Grip (BAE) Pty Ltd (in liq) v WorkCover Queensland; CSR Ltd v WorkCover
Queensland [2022] QCA 204
The outcome of these significant appeals turned on the meaning of the words “has … taken
proceedings to recover, damages” in the chapeau to s 207B(8) Workers’ Compensation and
Rehabilitation Act 2003. The worker had filed a claim and statement of claim against the
employer in the District Court but that claim was never served. Kelly J (Morrison and Mullins
JJA agreeing) held that a person cannot be said to have “taken proceedings” until the
proceeding has been served. Kelly J further explained that if a person to whom compensation
has been paid takes proceedings to recover damages then the insurer’s entitlement to be
indemnified will have to await the determination of that proceeding. But “no action or inaction
by the person to whom compensation has been paid” will affect or extinguish the right of the
insurer to be indemnified.
Morrison and Mullins JJA and Kelly J
21 October 2022
The respondent paid compensation to an injured worker who had developed malignant mesothelioma
which was attributed to his having inhaled asbestos dust during the course of his employment. The
respondent claimed an indemnity under s 207B(8)(a) Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act
2003 against the three appellants. Prior to the Supreme Court Proceeding, the injured worker had filed
a claim and statement of claim (albeit they were not served and are now stale). [3].
Section 207B(8) provides:
“(8) If a person who has received compensation has not recovered, or taken proceedings to
recover, damages for the injury from another person, other than the worker’s employer—
(a) the insurer is entitled to be indemnified for the amount of the compensation by the other
person to the extent of that person’s liability for the damages, so far as the amount of
damages payable for the injury by that person extends; and
(b) to that end, the insurer is subrogated to the rights of the person for the injury.”
The appellants unsuccessfully applied to strike out the respondent’s statement of claim or for summary
judgment. On appeal, they contended that the primary judge ought to have found that, on the Act’s
proper construction, the insurer was not entitled to claim the indemnity since the worker had taken
proceedings to recover damages for his injury from another person other than his employer within the
meaning of that language as it appears in the chapeau to s 207B(8) of the Act. In addition, CSR Limited
argued that when the worker commenced proceedings, the respondent’s cause of action was lost
against any alleged wrongdoer. [4]. Conversely the respondent argued that in circumstances where the
worker had filed but not served proceedings, he had “not recovered damages” for his injury and
accordingly the insurer was entitled to claim the indemnity. The respondent submitted that that is
because the first limb of the chapeau to s 207B(8) “has not recovered damages” is an alternative to the
second limb “has not … taken proceedings to recover, damages”. [20].
The Court’s interpretation of the critical words in the chapeau
Queensland Law Reporter – 4 November 2022 – [2022] 43 QLR
4

;The Court preferred a construction which was aligned with the purpose of s 207B(8), noting that in
WorkCover Queensland v Amaca Pty Ltd (2010) 241 CLR 420, 438 [48] the High Court recognised that
the policy of the Act “indicates that [the insurer] is entitled to be indemnified for moneys if paid in
compensation…”. In the lead judgment, Justice Kelly commented that:
1. The expression “taken proceedings” as it appears in s 207B(8) should not be taken to be a
literal reference to the mere filing of an originating process; [38];
2. A plain meaning of “to take” includes “to conduct”, “to use”, “to get the use of”, “to make use
of”, “to avail oneself of” and “to have recourse to”; [39];
3. It is not until the originating process is served and jurisdiction is thereby conferred upon the
court that a person is able to be properly described as having taken or as taking, in the sense
of using, proceedings to recover damages; [42];
4. The fact that “taken” as it appears in s 207B(8) is in the form of the past participle is
noteworthy since when one considers the purpose of the Act and the rights of subrogation
conferred by paragraph (b) of s 207B(8), it would follow that “taken” is intended to refer to an
existing state of affairs, namely a proceeding which is being taken to recover damages. A
proceeding which has been served will come within that description whilst it remains subject
to the supervision of the court and has not been determined, dismissed or discontinued; [43];
5. In accordance with the policy of the Act, no action or inaction on behalf of a recipient of
compensation should nullify the insurer’s statutory right to indemnity. [47].
The Court held that the words “has … taken proceedings to recover, damages” refer to an existing
proceeding that is being used by the person to whom compensation has been paid to recover damages.
Accordingly, whilst that is the case, the insurer is unable to pursue the statutory right of indemnity. His
Honour clarified:
“The mere fact that a person who has received compensation has taken proceedings to recover
damages does not extinguish or defeat the insurer’s right of indemnity. Rather, that proceedings
are not being used to recover damages, is a condition of the enforcement of the right or a
contingency upon which the right is dependent.” [48].
Disposition
The appeals were dismissed with costs. [53], [54].

PROCEDURE – WHERE THE PLAINTIFF WAS REQUIRED TO GIVE NOTICE
BEFORE TAKING A STEP UNDER R 389(1) UCPR – WHERE THE PLAINTIFF
TOOK A STEP BEFORE THE NOTICE PERIOD ENDED – WHETHER THE COURT
COULD DECLARE THE IRREGULAR STEP EFFECTUAL UNDER R 371(2)(D)
UCPR – RR 371, 372, 389 UCPR
Lutheran Church of Australia Queensland District v Parups Waring Architects Pty Ltd
[2022] QSC 214
This case involved an application to declare an irregular step taken to be effectual, pursuant
to r 371(2)(d) UCPR. The irregularity arose because there was non-compliance with r 389(1)
UCPR in that one month’s notice was required to be given before taking of a step after service
of the relevant notice. At issue was whether the applicant required leave to proceed under
r 389(2) UCPR, because no effectual step had been taken for 2 years. Justice Crowley
Queensland Law Reporter – 4 November 2022 – [2022] 43 QLR
5

;considered that the applicant was able to apply under r 371(2)(d), and exercised the discretion
to declare the irregular step effectual.
Crowley J
26 September 2022 (ex tempore)
Background
This judgment arises out of proceedings in which the plaintiff seeks damages from the defendant
architectural firm, which designed a sporting facility for the plaintiff. [1]–[4]. Apart from the events in
issue in this application, the last formal step in the proceeding had been taken on 30 July 2020, when
the plaintiff provided the defendant with copies of certain documents. [6]. From that time until 13 June
2022, the plaintiff did not take any “step in the proceeding” (for the purposes of r 389 UCPR). [7].
On 13 June 2022, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant giving notice under r 389(1) UCPR that it
intended to take a step in the proceeding. [8]. That rule provides that if no step has been taken for 1
year, before taking any step, a party who wants to proceed must “give a month’s notice”. [10]. Contrary
to that requirement, on the same date the plaintiff also enclosed a copy of an expert report. [8]. This
constituted a step in the proceeding before the expiry of the one month notice period required by
r 389(1). [12].
On 19 August 2022, the plaintiff served a further list of documents on the defendant. That same day,
the defendant wrote to the plaintiff stating that it considered the proceeding to be stayed pursuant to
r 389(2) and that it considered the steps taken on 13 June 2022 and 19 August 2022 to be irregular
(“the irregular steps”). [9]. Rule 389(2) provides that if no step has been taken in a proceeding for 2
years, a new step may not be taken without the order of the court. [10]. Rule 371 provides that a failure
to comply with the rules (here, the failure to give the 1 month notice before taking any other step), is an
irregularity. [11].
The application to declare the irregular steps effectual
The plaintiff sought an order under r 371(2)(d), which provides that if there has been a failure to comply
with the UCPR, the court may “declare a document or step taken to be effectual”. [11].
Why the application was successful
Justice Crowley observed that the key issue was the interaction between rr 371 and 389 of the UCPR.
[1]. In his Honour’s view, the plaintiff was correct that if a declaration were to be made that the service
of the expert report was effectual under r 371(2)(d), then the irregularity would be rectified and it would
have constituted a step in the proceeding. In that event, a regular step would have been taken within 2
years since the last step, and so leave to proceed under r 389(2) would not be required. [27]. His Honour
noted that this conclusion was supported by Bond J in Ure v Robinson [2017] 2 Qd R 566, where his
Honour had said that:
“The proper construction of r 389(2) is that the ‘last step’ contemplated must be the last effectual
step, namely a step which was effectual because it was regular when taken, or a step which,
although irregular when taken, has since been declared to be effectual under the rules.”
(Emphasis added). [20].
Having concluded that the plaintiff was not required to seek leave to proceed under r 389(2) before its
application under r 371(2)(d) could be considered, his Honour then addressed whether the court should
exercise the discretion provided by that rule. [36]–[37]. In this regard, his Honour noted that there did
not appear to be any cases that attempt to “identify the matters that may be relevant to the exercise of
discretion under r 371(2)(d)”. [18]. In the circumstances of this case, however, his Honour appeared to
place particular weight on a number of considerations, including that:
(1) the purpose of r 371(1) is that an irregularity is not a nullity;
Queensland Law Reporter – 4 November 2022 – [2022] 43 QLR
6

;(2) the irregularity in this case was a “mistake or … oversight”, rather than deliberate;
(3) the step in this matter could have been regularly taken by waiting for one month before
serving the report. In effect, the irregularity here was due to “serving the report too early, not
too late”;
(4) the application for an order under r 371(2)(d) had been promptly sought;
(5) no prejudice on the part of the defendant had been identified, beyond delay in finalising the
litigation; and
(6) the delay in the proceeding did not amount to “unreasonable delay”. [37].
Having regard to those matters (amongst others), his Honour considered it appropriate to declare under
r 371(2)(d) that the irregular steps were effectual. [38].

PROCEDURE – DECLARATIONS – WHERE THE APPLICANTS PROPOSE A
TRANSFER RELATING TO SUPERANNUATION FUNDS AND MEMBERS –
WHERE THE APPLICANTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL CRIMINAL
LIABILITY – WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO MAKE DECLARATIONS
H.E.S.T Australia Ltd v Attorney-General; Mercy Super Pty Ltd v Attorney-General
[2022] QSC 221
This case arose out of a proposed transfer of superannuation fund assets and members. The
applicant superannuation trustees were concerned that the proposed transaction might
contravene certain offence provisions (including s 422F of the Criminal Code 1899), which
relate to the provision of an inducement or reward for the substitution of a trustee. Justice Kelly
concluded that the offence provisions would not be contravened, and made declarations to
that effect. His Honour also gave directions that the trustees would be justified in effecting the
transaction.
Kelly J
17 October 2022
Background
Mercy Super Pty Ltd is trustee of a superannuation fund, the governing law of which is the law of
Queensland. [1]. It proposes to undertake a “successor fund transfer”, which will involve a transfer of its
members and assets to another superannuation fund – the HESTA superannuation fund (for which the
governing law is the law of Victoria). [3]. Such a transfer would be made pursuant to provisions in the
Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth). [4]. The proposed transaction would be effected
by transaction documents which contain various promises, including that the Mercy Super trustee would
be indemnified by HESTA in certain respects. [4].
This judgment concerns applications brought by both Mercy Super and HESTA (“the applicants”),
seeking declarations that the proposed transactions (including the promises under the transaction
documents) would not contravene s 442F of the Queensland Criminal Code 1899 or s 180 Crimes Act
1958 (Vic). [7]. Alternatively, the applicants sought assent or directions that it would be justified in
entering the proposed transaction, pursuant to s 96 Trusts Act 1973 (and an equivalent provision in
Victoria). [49], [54], [57].
Why the declarations / directions were sought
Queensland Law Reporter – 4 November 2022 – [2022] 43 QLR
7

;The impetus for the applications was a recent decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales – BT
Funds Management Ltd as trustee for the Retirement Wrap Superannuation Fund [2022] NSWSC 401.
In that judgment, Ball J gave consent to a proposed superannuation fund transfer but indicated that
without such consent the transaction “may have amounted to a breach” of s 249E Crimes Act 1990
(NSW). [6]. Queensland and Victoria have analogous provisions (discussed below).
The applicants were concerned that the proposed transaction (which includes the promises in the
transaction documents) may, if Ball J’s view were accepted, contravene ss 442F Queensland Criminal
Code 1899 and s 180 Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) (“the offence provisions”). [6]–[7], [14]. The offence
provisions are both entitled “Secret commission to trustee in return for substituted appointment”. In
broad terms, the provisions make it an offence for a person to give consideration to a trustee as an
inducement or reward for being substituted as the trustee (unless the persons beneficially entitled to the
estate, or a judge of the Supreme Court, assents). [9]–[10]. The purpose of the offence provisions is to
prevent a trustee from being persuaded by the prospect of personal gain to exercise a power to appoint
a substitute trustee. [18].
The applicants argued that, on their proper construction, the offence provisions would not be
contravened by the proposed transaction. [20]. None of the respondents (the Attorneys General for
Queensland and Victoria, or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) pressed the contrary view.
[21].
Why the declarations sought were made
Justice Kelly accepted the applicants’ submission that the proposed transaction would not contravene
the offence provisions because those provisions were concerned only with the “appointment” of a
substitute trustee. [29]. His Honour considered that the term “appointment” has an established meaning,
and is different from what was proposed here. In this case the transaction documents did not concern a
power to appoint a substitute trustee to the Mercy Super trust, but instead to facilitate the transfer of
members and funds to a different trust (the HESTA fund). [30]–[31]. As to the decision in BT Funds
Management, Kelly J considered that this did not contain “a ratio decidendi directed to the principal
question before me”. His Honour also observed that the judgment there had been given ex parte in
circumstances of urgency. [19].
In this case, his Honour considered that the declarations sought – that the proposed transactions would
not contravene the offence provisions – should be made. [47]. His Honour said he was “particularly
influenced” by the fact that a “pure question of law” was involved, the conduct “has not yet occurred”,
and that there is “significant utility in the declarations” (amongst other matters). [47]. To the extent the
declaration sought concerned s 180 Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), jurisdiction was afforded by cross-vesting
legislation. [48].
Assent or directions to the trustees
In the alternative, the applicants sought assent or directions about entry into the proposed transaction.
[49]. Notably, the offence provisions both indicated that they would not be contravened where the
“assent … of a judge of the Supreme Court” had been provided. [9]–[10]. Justice Kelly considered that
this should be construed as a reference “to the supervisory jurisdiction of a judge of the Supreme Court
with respect to trust administration”. [51]. In Queensland, a power to give directions to a trustee is
provided by s 96 Trusts Act 1973. [54]. There is an equivalent provision in Victoria’s Supreme Court
Rules. [57].
His Honour considered that this was also an appropriate case to make the directions sought – namely,
that the applicants would be justified in effecting the proposed transaction. [61]. In particular, his Honour
observed that the proposed transaction was considered by the Mercy Super trustee to be in the best
financial interests of its members. Similarly, the HESTA trustee considered the proposed transaction
would be in the best interests of the members of both funds. [61]. Again, his Honour considered that the
jurisdiction to give directions pursuant to the equivalent Victorian provision was enabled by cross-vesting
provisions. [60].

Devmin International Pty Ltd v Belconnen Developments Pty Ltd [2022] QSC 186
In this interesting matter, the applicant creditor took action to recover the respondent’s debt
from its guarantor, who disputed the debt. The guarantor later entered administration and was
liquidated before a trial took place. The applicant in turn applied to have the respondent wound
up on one of three grounds. First, pursuant to s 461(1)(c) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (“the
Act”), because it had suspended its business for a year. Second, pursuant to s 461(1)(k) of the
Act, on just and equitable grounds. Third, pursuant to ss 459A or 459B of the Act, on the basis
that the respondent was insolvent. Cooper J determined that orders pursuant to s 461(1)(c)
would deprive the respondent of the opportunity to contest or repay the debt before being
wound up. For that reason, and because an alleged lack of confidence was not established, it
was not just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 461(1)(k). Similarly, there was no
adequate evidence or basis from which to infer insolvency and make orders pursuant to ss
459A or 459B. In the result, the application was dismissed with costs.
Cooper J
19 October 2022
Background
The applicant, Devmin International Pty Ltd (“Devmin”), was the assignee of a debt owed by the
respondent, and thereby its creditor for the purposes of ss 459P(1)(b) and 462(2)(b) Corporations Act
2001 (Cth) (“the Act”). [1], [27]. The respondent, Belconnen Developments Pty Ltd (“Belconnen”), was
one of several companies incorporated to engage in various aspects of a property development
business under the name “Parity Group”. [1], [12]. The sole director and secretary, Mr Garden, was also
the sole director and shareholder of Garden Bells Pty Ltd, Belconnen’s sole shareholder. [11].
The relevant debt arose in the context of dealings between Mr Garden and the director of Hollistic
Property Group Pty Ltd (“Hollistic”), Mr O’Dwyer, regarding a proposed development. [14]–[15]. Mr
Garden contended that during their dealings, Mr O’Dwyer made representations about his capacity to
raise funds for the development. [16]–[19]. Belconnen later had to borrow funds from Hollistic to meet
its commitments, apparently after Mr O’Dwyer failed to raise those funds. [20]–[21]. Mr Garden alleged
that the development ultimately could not proceed because of Mr O’Dwyer’s failures. [26].
Hollistic had assigned its rights to Devmin shortly before the loan fell due. [27]. Devmin later demanded
payment, and after it was not forthcoming, demanded payment from Belconnen’s guarantor, Parity
Developments Pty Ltd (“Parity”). [23], [28]. In response, Parity made a Calderbank offer to settle the
dispute by paying the demand in full. [29]. Devmin did not accept the offer, and later instituted
proceedings against Parity seeking repayment. [30]–[31]. Parity defended the proceeding inter alia on
the basis of alleged misrepresentations made by Mr O’Dwyer. [31].
Before a trial could take place, Parity entered voluntary administration, and subsequently, liquidation.
[13], [31]. Devmin in turn applied to wind up Belconnen on three grounds. [3], [31]. First, pursuant to
s 461(1)(c) of the Act, on the basis that Belconnen had suspended its business for a whole year. [3].
Second, on grounds that it was just and equitable for Belconnen to be wound up, pursuant to s 461(1)(k)

;of the Act. [3]. Third, pursuant to ss 459A or 459B of the Act, on the basis that Belconnen was insolvent.

It was not in contention that Belconnen had not traded for more than a year. [42]. The discretion to make
an order under s 461(1)(c) thus arose on the facts. [44]. However, Cooper J considered that it was
necessary to determine the appropriateness of such an order in the context of Devmin’s inferred purpose
in seeking it, namely, repayment of the debt. [45]. In that respect, his Honour highlighted Belconnen’s
argument that Devmin had not sued on the debt or issued a statutory demand because it was aware
that the debt was disputed on the grounds previously ventilated by Parity. [45].
Cooper J considered Belconnen’s disputes about the debt should more properly have been heard in the
context of a summary judgment application in an action for the debt, or an application to set aside a
statutory demand. [47]. If Belconnen’s arguments were found not to be genuine, it would still have the
chance to pay the debt before it could be wound up. [47]. The instant application deprived it of that
opportunity. [47]. For that reason and having regard to the historical purpose of orders under the
provision, his Honour determined not to make an order under s 461(1)(c) of the Act. [49].
Just and equitable
His Honour noted Devmin’s contention that the facts raised two of six identified categories for making
an order on just and equitable grounds, being the failure of the substratum of the company and/or lack
of confidence, fairness, and the public interest in commercial morality. [51]. There was a significant
degree of overlap between the first category and an order pursuant to s 461(1)(c) of the Act. [53]. His
Honour therefore considered that, even if Devmin could make out its case, an order due to failure of the
substratum of the company was inappropriate for much the same reasons already identified. [62].
Devmin’s contention in respect of the second category was that certain conduct of Mr Garden gave rise
to a lack of confidence in the conduct and management of Belconnen’s affairs. [70]. However, even
taking the evidence of any alleged misconduct at its highest, Cooper J was not satisfied that it gave rise
to a lack of confidence in Belconnen’s administration. [76]. The alleged conduct, which concerned other
companies controlled by Mr Garden was not so pervasive as to make it just and equitable that Belconnen
be wound up. [76].
Insolvency
With respect to the final ground, Cooper J noted Devmin had adduced no evidence indicating insolvency.
[79]–[80]. Instead, it had relied on four matters to support an inference that Belconnen was insolvent.
[81]. First, it pointed to Belconnen’s failure to repay the debt. [82], Second, it argued Parity’s Calderbank
offer was an admission that the debt was owing. [83], Third, it highlighted that there were multiple
proceedings seeking to recover money from companies in the Parity Group. [86]. Fourth, Devmin relied
on Belconnen’s failure to adduce evidence of its solvency. [87].
Cooper J explained that even if it was assumed that Parity’s offer was an admission, it was subject to
without prejudice privilege. [85]. It could not prove the debt against Parity or Belconnen, and having
been made by Parity, was not an admission by Belconnen. [85]. None of the proceedings Devmin
pointed to involved it or Belconnen. [86]. The authorities identified by Devmin did not support the
argument that Belconnen’s failure to adduce evidence of its solvency could be relied upon by Devmin
where other evidence was not sufficient to establish that fact. [87].
Given that Belconnen otherwise disputed the obligation to pay the debt, his Honour was not satisfied
that the evidence was sufficient to permit an inference that Belconnen was insolvent. [89].
Disposition
In the result, Cooper J dismissed Devmin’s application with costs. [90]–[91].

WORKERS’ COMPENSATION – WHETHER A DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
PROVIDED IN NOTICE OF CLAIM FOR DAMAGES PROVIDED THE REQUISITE
DETAILS – S 275 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION AND REHABILITATION ACT
2003, REG 120 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION AND REHABILITATION
REGULATION 2014
Graham v State of Queensland [2022] QSC 228
The question which arose in this application was whether a notice of claim for damages under
the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003 claiming damages for psychiatric
injuries alleged to be sustained from working for the respondent as a correctional services
officer was a compliant notice in terms of its description of the “event” claimed. His Honour
declared that the notice complied with s 275 and clarified that the test is not to require a
properly particularised statement of claim, but rather to satisfy the “substantially lesser”
requirement of reg 120(b) Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Regulation 2014.
Crow J
20 October 2022
The relevant notice which the applicant gave to the respondent alleged psychiatric/psychological injury
arising out of his employment as a corrective services officer. [1], [2]. The respondent argued that it was
non-compliant given the applicant did not properly particularise the “event” pursuant to regulation 120.
[10]. In that regard, the notice stated as follows:
“The claimant was a member of the correctional response team on a permanent basis. The
claimant transferred into the correctional response team on or about 16th October 2019. The role
of the correctional response team is to be the first responders to critical and acute prisoner
situations. There was no rotation in and out of the correctional response team. Prior to the
commencements [sic] of his role as a tactical response officer the claimant received
approximately 3 days training primarily in physical fitness.” [2].
The applicant sought a declaration that he had in fact complied with s 275 of the Act. [17].
Was the notice compliant?
The primary purpose of a notice of claim is to facilitate the settlement of claims: see Callaghan v
WorkCover Queensland [2000] QSC 125, [21]. Section 275(3) of the Act stipulates that the notice must
include the particulars prescribed under a regulation. Regulation 120 of the Act states that a notice of
claim is required to contain certain particulars.
The respondent argued that there were various difficulties and discrepancies between the notice and
the subsequent correspondence. [28]. His Honour also noted that the factual basis of the case contained
in the applicant’s psychiatrist’s report differed from that contained in the notice. [30]. Notwithstanding
those matters, the court held that given there is a distinction between the notice of claim for damages
and the documents required to accompany it (see s 257(8)), the recitation of the nature of the claim in
one of the accompanying documents could not be used to challenge the adequacy of the description of
the event in the notice itself, and nor could subsequent correspondence. [39].
His Honour observed that pursuant to reg 120, the claimant’s description of the facts and circumstances
surrounding his suffering of the injury are key. In that regard, his Honour noted that whilst the description
of the event in the applicant’s notice would be “woefully inadequate” in pleading a claim, that is not the
test:
Queensland Law Reporter – 4 November 2022 – [2022] 43 QLR
11

;“The test is whether Mr Graham, as the applicant has, in the terms of reg 120(b) described the
facts of the circumstances surrounding his injury”. [41].
Here, the applicant had canvassed specific matters relating to his duties, lack of rotation and lack of
training in particularising the “event”. [42]. He omitted to include any allegations of fact. [43]. The
response which he provided was drafted without the assistance of his solicitors. [44].
By contrast to the meticulous requirements for pleading a pure psychiatric injury claim, regulation 120(b)
does not demand the same level of detail: (see Scott v K & S Freighters [1999] QSC 427, wherein
Justice R. Douglas stated that all is required is a description of what occurred so as to enable an
employer to readily ascertain the nature of the claim). [20], [45]. Here, his Honour was satisfied that the
claimant’s description of the facts and circumstances surrounding his suffering of the injury in the notice
was sufficient. [46].
Disposition
The court declared that the Notice of Claim for Damages complied with s 275 Workers’ Compensation
and Rehabilitation Act 2003 and heard the parties as to costs.

Thales Australia Ltd v Madritsch KG [2022] QCA 205
In this appeal, the appellant advanced a number of grounds of appeal against the primary
judge’s finding that it had misused confidential information in developing its weapons
technology. Two of those grounds are considered in this note. The first (ground 1) concerns
the principles applicable where a case alleging misuse of confidential information is sought to
be proved by circumstantial evidence. The second (ground 3) concerns situations in which
confidentiality can be said to be maintained, notwithstanding disclosure to a third party. The
appellant failed on all grounds. The appeal was dismissed.
Morrison and Mullins JJA and Freeburn J
21 October 2022
Background
All three parties to the litigation are in the firearms trade. The appellant, Thales Australia Limited
(“Thales”) manufactures and supplies a rifle used by the Australian Defence Force. Its design was based
upon a similar weapon used by the Austrian army (the Bundesheer). [3].
Both weapons suffered from a defect described as the “Bolt Unlocking Problem”. [4].
Between March and October 2008, Australia’s Defence Material Organisation (“DMO”) developed a
prototype for a possible engineering solution to the Bolt Unlocking Problem. [5].
Queensland Law Reporter – 4 November 2022 – [2022] 43 QLR
12

;In Austria, at around the same time, Madritsch KG (“Madritsch”) was developing its own. Its solution
was called the “Madritsch Solution”. [6].
By August 2009, the Madritsch Solution had been tested and approved by the Bundesheer. [7].
Meanwhile, between 2009–2011, the DMO prototype manufacturing stalled. [14]–[16]. During this
period, Thales sought to test whether the Madritsch Solution would solve the Bolt Unlocking Problem.
Madritsch was reluctant to supply details without a confidentiality agreement. [17].
After signing two non-disclosure agreements, Madritsch disclosed the manual for the Madritsch Solution
and delivered six “kits” to Thales. [22]. Thales inspected the manual and kits. In that way, Thales’
representatives came to know of two specific features of the Madritsch Solution, which became
significant (and known as the “Two Features”). [23].
In September 2011, Thales successfully tested the Madritsch Solution kits. They proved to alleviate the
Bolt Unlocking Problem. [24]. However, Thales “choked” on the price attached to buying them. [27], [30].
As a result, Thales decided to resume development of the shelved DMO prototype. [30].
By May 2012, Thales had developed its new prototype. That version included the “Two Features” Thales
had learned of in inspecting the manual and kits of the Madritsch Solution. [32].
The use of this design was discovered by Madritsch representatives at a trade show in Paris where the
DMO Prototype was displayed. [33]. (Incidentally, at the time of the Paris trade show, Thales had not
yet returned the Madritsch kits it had received ten months earlier. [35].)
The case at first instance
Madritch’s concerns about the misuse of its confidential information led to it commencing these
proceedings.
The primary judge found that Thales misused the confidential information regarding the Madritsch
solution, contrary to Thales’ obligations in the non-disclosure agreements, and contrary to Thales’
equitable duty of confidence. [36].
His Honour did so in the context of a wholly circumstantial case.
Ground 1: Finding misuse of confidential information in a circumstantial case
The appellant’s first ground of appeal was that there was an error in the approach taken by the trial
judge. [73]. They argued that the inferences drawn were unavailable and that in drawing them, the trial
judge effectively reversed the onus of proof. [77], [89].
Justice Freeburn (with whom Morrison and Mullins JJA agreed) rejected those arguments. In addressing
them, his Honour stated the relevant principles applicable where a case alleging misuse of confidential
information is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence at [38]–[47].
Applying those principles, the Court held that the primary judge had not erred. In this case, the “identity
of characteristics” between the Madritsch Solution and the DMO prototype, the quick progress of the
DMO protocol and Thales’ inability to demonstrate that it was the result of its own ingenuity was
determinative. [69].
Ground 3: Whether the Madritsch Solution lost its character of confidentiality
The appellant’s third ground was that the primary judge was wrong to have found that the Madritsch
solution maintained its confidential character, because it had been provided to the Bundsheer on three
separate occasions for testing purposes. [244].
In considering this argument, Freeburn J recited the following principles:
Queensland Law Reporter – 4 November 2022 – [2022] 43 QLR
13

;1. Whether information previously disclosed to a limited public has entered the public domain
is a question of degree. Quoting, Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No 3), “Information will be confidential
if it is available to one person (or a group of people) and not generally available to others,
provided that the person (or group) who possess the information does not intend that it
should become available to others. [246].
2. Information does not enter the public domain where it is given or received in circumstances
importing an obligation of confidence. The test to be used is the “reasonable man test”
advanced by Megarry J in Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd. [247].
Applying those principles from Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd, Freeburn J concluded that, “a
reasonable person in the Bundesheer’s position would have realised that Mr Madritsch provided the
Madritsch solution in confidence for the following reasons”: [250]:
1. Mr Madritsch provided the kits to Obst Weinsei of the Bundesheer to test for the purposes of
the Bundesheer deciding whether to adopt the Madritsch Solution for their weapon;
2. the Bundesheer must have appreciated that the Madritsch Solution was of commercial value,
which Madritsch was concerned to protect;
3. the testing was relevant to the possible use of the Madritsch Solution by the Bundesheer and
so its confidential nature was relevant to the defence of Austria; and
4. the Bundesheer had a direct economic interest in having access to the kits and testing them
for the purpose of determining whether to adopt and purchase the Madritsch Solution.
As the Madritsch Solution cannot be said to have entered the public domain in the sense that it was “so
generally accessible that, in all the circumstances, it cannot be regarded as confidential”, the relevant
disclosures could therefore not be said to lack confidentiality. [251]–[252].
Disposition
Appeal dismissed on all grounds.

Titles Scheme 25277 [2022] QSC 222
The plaintiffs brought an application for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendant
from undertaking work to remove a wall which had been constructed on Common Property in
a commercial building. The plaintiffs substantive claim was for relief under Pt 11 Property Law
Act 1974. At issue was whether the wall was an encroachment within the meaning of s 184 of
the PLA. Martin SJA held that the wall was not an encroachment because, not only was it
constructed entirely on common property, but it also could not be described as a building.

;The plaintiff sought orders under s 184 Property Law Act 1974 (“the PLA”) that part of the common
property in a building upon which they claimed that there had been an encroachment be transferred to
them. [1].
The plaintiffs own Lot 5 which is on the second level in a two-level commercial building in Robina. [4].
Lot 5 shares a boundary with the common property. At some point in time a wall was erected that cut
across the common property between the corner of the toilets and the internal side of the building’s
exterior wall (“the Wall Assembly”). [5]. The effect of the Wall Assembly was to enclose 29 square metres
of common property for the sole use of the owner or tenant of Lot 5 (“the Disputed Area”). In 1998 the
plaintiffs purchased Lot 5 but, they claimed, it was not until 2013 that they became aware that the
Disputed Area was not part of Lot 5. [6]. In September 2022 the defendant commenced work to remove
the Wall Assembly and other associated office structures in the Disputed Area. The plaintiff applied for
an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendant pending determination of the plaintiff’s substantive
claim for relief brought pursuant to Pt 11 of the PLA.[9].
The Court dismissed the application for an interlocutory injunction on the ground that the plaintiff had
failed to establish a prima facie case for two reasons:
(i) the Wall Assembly was not an encroachment for the purpose of Pt 11 of the PLA because
the Wall Assembly was built entirely on the common property and it did not “traverse any
boundary between the common property and Lot 5”. [18];
(ii) the Wall Assembly (and office structures) were not buildings within the definition of Pt 11 of
the PLA. The mere fact that the Wall Assembly had been in place for a number of years did
not mean it could be described as a substantial or permanent structure. [28].
The Court also found that the balance of convenience did not support the grant of an injunction. [33]–
[34]. The plaintiff’s statement of claim was also struck out with leave to replead. [46]–[47].

Queensland Reports) available online to the community and free of charge.
On 4 September 2020, a new version of the Queensland Judgments website was launched, which
expanded its coverage to all Queensland Courts and Tribunals. This content will be continuously
updated upon the delivery of each judgment or decision authorised for publication from all Queensland
Courts and Tribunals.
